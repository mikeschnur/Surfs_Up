# Surfs_Up

# Purpose
An investor looking into the logistics of a specific surf and ice cream shop and is a little reluctant to commit their funds toward the project without a report on the weather in the area and whether it is often the adeqeuate temperature for surfing as well as ice cream. Through the use of SQLAlchemy a SQLite database was queried and analyzed to show past data from the months of June and December.

- The mean temperature of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December.
- The maximum and minimum temperatures are higher in June than in December.
- The temperature varies more in December than in June.

## Summary
The data from June and December indicates that the temperature seems to not vary all that much throughout the year, showing only a three degree difference in the average temperature between June and December. While the temperature seemed to stay above seventy degrees for the vast majority of days, which would be permitting for surfing and ice cream sales. Two more queries that would be useful in this case would display the precipitation in the location in June and December. This would prove useful for our investor because they had expressed concern regarding the level of rain the shop location could recieve and its possible negative effects on business performance.
