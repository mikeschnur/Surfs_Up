# Surfs_Up

# Purpose
An investor looking into the logistics of a specific surf and ice cream shop and is a little reluctant to commit their funds toward the project without a report on the weather in the area and whether it is often the adeqeuate temperature for surfing as well as ice cream. Through the use of SQLAlchemy a SQLite database was queried and analyzed to show past data from the months of June and December.

# Results
## Temperature Data for June
